Tutorial
========

Exploring basic rules
---------------------

Let's try exploring the `/assets` endpoint:

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/asset-listing.http
   :language: javascript

Just invoking it reveals empty set.

Now let's attempt creating some asset:

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/asset-post-attempt.http
   :language: javascript

Error states that the only accepted Content-Type is `application/json`.

Let's satisfy the Content-type requirement:

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/asset-post-attempt-json.http
   :language: javascript

Error states that no `data` has been found in JSON body.


.. index:: Asset

Creating asset
--------------

Let's create asset with the minimal data set:

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/asset-post-2pc.http
   :language: javascript

The object you're trying to add initially receives `draft` status. For the asset to be created within the Registry, it should be manually switched to `pending` status (2 Phase Commit mechanism):

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/asset-patch-2pc.http
   :language: javascript

Success! Now we can see that new object was created. Response code is `201`
and `Location` response header reports the location of the created object.  The
body of response reveals the information about the created asset: its internal
`id` (that matches the `Location` segment), its official `assetID` and
`dateModified` datestamp stating the moment in time when asset was last
modified. Pay attention to the `assetType`. Note that asset is
created with `pending` status.

Let's access the URL of the created object (the `Location` header of the response):

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/blank-asset-view.http
   :language: javascript

.. XXX body is empty for some reason (printf fails)

We can see the same response we got after creating asset.

Let's see what listing of assets reveals us:

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/initial-asset-listing.http
   :language: javascript

We do see the internal `id` of a asset (that can be used to construct full URL by prepending `http://lb.api-sandbox.registry.ea2.openprocurement.net/api/<api_version>/assets/`) and its `dateModified` datestamp.

Let's create another asset:

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/create-second-asset.http
   :language: javascript

After switching  this object to `pending`, let's check what assets registry contains:

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/listing-with-some-assets.http
   :language: javascript

And indeed we have 2 assets now.

Modifying Asset
---------------

Let's update asset description:

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/patch-asset.http
   :language: javascript

.. XXX body is empty for some reason (printf fails)

We see the added properties have merged with existing asset data. Additionally, the `dateModified` property was updated to reflect the last modification date stamp.

`Note` that the asset can be modified only within the rectification period (up to `rectificationPeriod.endDate`).

Checking the listing again reflects the new modification date:

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/asset-listing-after-patch.http
   :language: javascript

Let's modify one of the items added before:

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/update-item.http
   :language: javascript

Deleting Asset
--------------

Let's delete asset. 

Firstly, a document with the `documentType: canellationDetails` has to be added:

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/add_cancellation_document.http
   :language: javascript

And now asset can be easily deleted:

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/delete-asset.http
   :language: javascript

Integration with lots
---------------------

As long as the lot is formed, the system should verify whether the asset can be attached to that lot. With the lot status being changed to `verification` the asset automatically reaches `verification` as well. 

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/asset_switch_to_verification.http
   :language: javascript

In case of the asset being available, its status automatically becomes `active`.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/attached-to-lot-asset-view.http
   :language: javascript

If the lot is formed incorrectly, the asset will automatically receive `pending` status and so that the `relatedLot` field will be empty.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/detached-from-lot-asset-view.http
   :language: javascript


As long as the lot status becomes either `pending.deleted` or `pending.dissolution`, the asset attached to that lot also receives `pending` status.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/detached-from-lot-asset-view.http
   :language: javascript

As long as the lot receives `pending.sold` status, the asset attached to that lot becomes `complete`.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/complete-asset-view.http
      :language: javascript
