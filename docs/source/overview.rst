Overview
========

openregistry.assets.bounce contains the description of the Registry Data Base.

Features
--------

* Asset represents the initial information of an object to be privatized.
* The object to be created should be switched from `draft` to `pending`.
* Asset is being created with the automatically added `documentType: informationDetails`. 
* Asset is a complicated entity the components of which are marked as items.
* For the asset to be deleted, the specific document (`documentType: cancellationDetails`) has to be attached.

Conventions
-----------

API accepts `JSON <http://json.org/>`_ or form-encoded content in
requests.  It returns JSON content in all of its responses, including
errors.  Only the UTF-8 character encoding is supported for both requests
and responses.

All API POST and PUT requests expect a top-level object with a single
element in it named `data`.  Successful responses will mirror this format. 
The data element should itself be an object, containing the parameters for
the request.

If the request was successful, we will get a response code of `201`
indicating the object was created.  That response will have a data field at
its top level, which will contain complete information on the new auction,
including its ID.

If something went wrong during the request, we'll get a different status
code and the JSON returned will have an `errors` field at the top level
containing a list of problems.  We look at the first one and print out its
message.
